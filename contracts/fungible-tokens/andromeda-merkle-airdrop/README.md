# Overview

The Merkle-Airdrop ADO is a smart contract that allows projects to launch airdrops using the Merkle-tree (hashing). Uses the same logic of the [base cw20-merkel-airdrop](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-tokens/tree/main/contracts/cw20-merkle-airdrop) contract. If you do not know what is a Merkle-airdrop and how it is different from a normal airdrop, please refer to the following [article](https://medium.com/smartz-blog/merkle-airdrop-the-basics-9a0857fcc930).
