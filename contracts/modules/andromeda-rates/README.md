# Overview

The Rates ADO is a smart contract that can be used to hold rates configurations for other ADOs. Instead of setting up the rate on the ADO itself, the ADO can reference this ADO to extract the rates set up and apply them on the ADO. These rates can be used to add a fee that is paid on a message, whether a tax or royalty. 

**Note**: This ADO is not released yet. Once released, a link to full documentation will be provided.
