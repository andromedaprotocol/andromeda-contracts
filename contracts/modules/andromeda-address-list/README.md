# Overview

The address list ADO is a smart contract that facilitates setting up permissions for ADOs. Instead of setting up the permission on the ADO itself, the owner can reference this ADO instead.

Permissioning allows ADO owners to give/restrict access to addresses to execute messages on their ADOs.

**Note**: This ADO is not released yet. Once released, a link to full documentation will be provided.
