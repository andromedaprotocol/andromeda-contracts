# Overview

The Timelock ADO or Escrow ADO is a smart contract built to hold funds (Native coins) for a period of time until the set condition is satisfied. 
There are two main conditions that can be used by the contract:
- **Expiration:** A time expiration to when the funds can be released.
- **MinimumFunds:** A minimum amount of funds to be deposited before they can be released.

Once a condition is satisfied, the funds can be released.
