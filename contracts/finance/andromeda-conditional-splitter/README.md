# Overview

The Conditional Splitter ADO is a smart contract used to split funds to specified recipients based on the amount that is sent. At instantiation, the owner specifies the recipient sets along with the minimum amount of funds needed for each set. 
The ADO can be locked by the owner meaning that the recipient lists cannot be changed for the duration of the lock.

**Note**: This ADO is not released yet. Once released, a link to full documentation will be provided.
