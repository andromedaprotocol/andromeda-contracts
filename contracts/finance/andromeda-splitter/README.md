# Overview

The Splitter ADO is a smart contract used to split funds to a preset number of addresses. Each of the addresses has a specific percentage assigned by the contract owner. The splitter can be locked for a specified time as a kind of insurance for recipients that their percentages will not be changed for a certain period of time. Whenever funds are sent to the splitter using the `Send` execute message, they are automatically distributed to the recipient set.
