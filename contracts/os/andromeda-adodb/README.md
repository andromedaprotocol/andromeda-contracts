# Overview
The Database ADO (ADODB) is a smart contract that is primarily used to store code Ids for  Andromeda ADOs. These code Ids are used to instantiate these ADOs in Andromeda Apps. The code Ids are stored within a key value pair where the key is the ADO type and the value is the ADO code Id.
The ADODB is also responsible for managing the economic engine of the Andromeda ecosystem, allowing ADO publishers  to set custom fees to be paid when interacting with one of their published ADOs. These fees can be set as native or a CW20 token.
