# Overview

The App ADO is a smart contract that is used to bundle up ADOs that will be interacting with each other into  what we call an  "App". It also offers a naming system that allows the contracts to reference each other by their assigned names rather than contract addresses. 
An ADO in the App is called an AppComponent. Every App would be composed of many of these components (up to 50). Each component is assigned a name which can be used by other components to reference each other. The App ADO allows us to instantiate all of these components in one go.
