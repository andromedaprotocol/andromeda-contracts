# Overview

The Crowdfund ADO is a smart contract that allows users to start a campaign and raise funds for their projects/goal by selling NFTs.
Each campaign can contain multiple tiers for different levels of support. For example you could have a bronze, silver, and gold tier for your crowdfund each having a specified price. All NFTs of the same tier share the same metadata. 

**Note**: This ADO is not released yet. Once released, a link to full documentation will be provided.
